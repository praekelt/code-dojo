=========================

In 1993 Neal Stephenson wrote a long Wired article, *Mother Earth

cables around our planet earth. It's an entertaining read and offers
some good insights into the physical skeleton of this nebulous thing
we call *the internet*.

It's probably best not to try read this during a dojo session, but
rather to read it between dojo sessions and discuss it at the
following one.
