Speed of Information and Computation
====================================

Modern electronic computers process and manipulate information
extremely quickly -- sometimes approaching the limits imposed by the
laws of physics. However, the time taken for different processes
varies vastly, even though to the human eye they might all appear
instantaneous. This lesson is about exploring the different time
scales involved in manipulating information on current computers.

* Find out what a CPU clock tick is.
* Find out how many of these your computer performs each second.
* Find out how far light can travel in a single clock tick.
* Trace an outline of your laptop on a whiteboard and draw how far
  light travels in a single clock tick on it.
* How many clock ticks does it take to add two numbers?
* To retrieve a number from memory?
* To retrieve a number from a hard disk?
* To retrieve a number from a solid state disk?
* To send a packet from your computer to a nearby wifi access point?
* To send a packet from your computer to a server in another country?
* To load a web page?
