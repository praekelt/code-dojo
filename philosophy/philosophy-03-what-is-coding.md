What is Coding?
===============

It can be hard to describe what coding is -- it covers everything from
working with punch cards, to machine code, to assembler, to C, to
dynamic languages like Python, and to complex spreadsheets and
workflows.

Start by simply answering "What is coding?" off the top of your
head. Discuss your answers and then look for more answers.
