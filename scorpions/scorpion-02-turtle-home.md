A House for a Turtle
====================

Python is a programming language with a simple, readable syntax and
which is well-suited both to writing small simple scripts and big
complex applications. It's a language that can grow with you as your
own coding skills and needs develop.

Python comes with a built in turtle. It knows how to follow simple
instructions but it doesn't have a home. Your task is to teach it how
to build one.

#### Part 1: Getting to know your turtle

The first step is just to open the Python interpreter, find the
turtle, and start giving it instructions. Starting trying to build a
house to get a feel for what sorts of instructions you'll be using.


#### Part 2: Communicating better

After playing with the turtle for a bit, you'll likely have
encountered some frustrations. You'll likely want to save your work,
re-use sets of instructions you've given the turtle before or tell the
turtle to repeat a set of instructions a number of times. For these
you'll need:

* To install and open a text editor for saving code in
* To learn about functions
* To learn about loops
