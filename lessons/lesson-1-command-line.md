Lesson 1: Command Line
======================

Welcome to the first Praekelt Code Dojo lesson!

Each lesson will have two components -- a short "philosophical" part
(what are computers, what is coding) and a longer "practical" part
(writing code, making computers do things). Each practical component
comes with a "scorpion" -- a tasty exercise for the student to defeat.

Lessons are not necessarily intended to be completed in a single dojo
session. Students and instructors work on a lesson until they feel it
has been mastered or that it is time to move on.

This first lesson looks at what a computer is physically and
introduces the command line.


Philosophy
----------

Take a screw driver. Open a laptop or other computer. Ask questions
about what you find.

Find other computers around you to open up and explore.


Practice
--------

The Unix command line interface (CLI) is a daily tool for many
software developers. We use it to install and run programs, inspect
the state of the computers we're using, move files and data around and
perform simple operations on data. The command line tools are
pre-installed on almost every Unix system (e.g. Linux, OS X).

Many small command line utilities are available. Each of them aims to
do one thing well and to be easily composable with others.

Being familiar with the comand line will help us install new tools
later, run the programs we write, and figure out what has gone wrong
when our programs produce unexpected output.


Scorpion
--------

* Download a pair of inbound and outbound message CSV files from a Vumi Go USSD conversation.

* Merge them and sort the rows by time.

* From the merged file, filter out the interactions with a single person.

* You should now have a file showing a single person's conversation with the USSD application.
