Lesson 1: Command Line
======================

Welcome to the first Praekelt Code Dojo lesson!

Each lesson will have two components -- a short "philosophical" part
(what are computers, what is coding) and a longer "practical" part
(writing code, making computers do things). Each practical component
comes with a "scorpion" -- a tasty exercise for the student to defeat.

Lessons are not necessarily intended to be completed in a single dojo
session. Students and instructors work on a lesson until they feel it
has been mastered or that it is time to move on.

This first lesson looks at what a computer is physically and
introduces the command line.
